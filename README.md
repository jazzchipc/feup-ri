A repository for the Intelligent Robotics (RI) course of FEUP's Doctoral Program in Informatics Engineering.

## IMPORTANT

In my own machine, I have commented the following line from the `bash.rc` file, because it was messing with my `PYTHONPATH` env variable:

```
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash 
```

When working with ROS, REMEMBER to source MANUALLY.
